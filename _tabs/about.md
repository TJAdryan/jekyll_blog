    <p>Hey there, welcome to NextValData! I'm Dominick, and this is my blog.</p>
    <p>"I'm lucky to be on a team with awesome and dedicated people, where we create solutions for a whole range of SaaS,PaaS and legacy system challenges. Day-to-day, I get to use a lot of great technology like Python, SQL, Spark, and Airflow, sometimes on cloud platforms like GCP, Azure, and AWS.  

    Whether I'm building out ETL/ELT pipelines, setting up data warehouses or data lakes, or even diving into the data from that classic 'keyring of thumb drives someone found in a drawer,' my aim is to make sure data is useful. One of the most important steps in making this happen, is understanding what colleagues and stakeholders need from these solutions. Or as I like to say, "Let's make it nice for the people."  

    Currently I am working as a Senior Engineer, developing API integrations, automating reporting and configuring and deploying cloud services."</p>
