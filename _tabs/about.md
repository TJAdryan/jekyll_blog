    <p>Hey there, welcome to NextValData! I'm Dominick, and this is my blog. I'm passionate about data and exploring new perspectives.</p>

    <p>Professionally, I'm a Senior Engineer specializing in API integrations, automated reporting, and cloud service deployment. I collaborate with a talented team to create solutions for diverse SaaS, PaaS, and legacy system challenges. My daily toolkit includes Python, SQL, Spark, and Airflow, often within cloud environments like GCP, Azure, and AWS.</p>

    <p>My goal is to ensure data is useful, whether I'm building ETL/ELT pipelines, setting up data warehouses or data lakes, or analyzing data from unconventional sources. Understanding the needs of colleagues and stakeholders is crucial. As I like to say, "Let's make it nice for the people."</p>
