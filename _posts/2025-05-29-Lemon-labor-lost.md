The Ongoing Quest for the Perfect Lemon Cookie: My Latest Disappointment (Lemon Oreos, We Need to Talk)
For weeks now, I've been on a quiet, personal quest: the search for the perfect lemon cookie. It's not some grand, dramatic saga; it's just a simple desire to find that one, truly sublime cookie that delivers a bright, zesty, and utterly satisfying lemon experience. No, I don't know what is wrong with me.  I just want what I want. 

So for a while now, I have been going to different grocery stores and looking for lemon cookie mixes or lemon-flavored cookies. The only ones with icing I could find where [lemon Oreos](https://www.oreo.com/products/oreo-lemon-cookies?Size=2+Pack).  I thought, well if this is the only one's they have I will give them a try.  I like regular Oreos.

I opened the package on the walk home. The cookie part had no lemon flavor, it was like one of those regualar 'Golden' Oreos. The filling was okay.  It had a mild lemon flavor but not what I was hoping for.  I understand in psychology some people are maximizers and some are satisficers. I am a maximizer.  I don't want to be but apparently I am at least when it comes to lemon cookies.  Because maximizers are always looking for the best.   But the rub is that even when they find it they have a comparatively less enjoyable experience than satisficers.  






I don't know what specific lemon cookie from my past set this high, yet seemingly unachievable, bar. But its memory drives my continued search. It might be that I am nostalgic or have unrealistic expections.  Anyway if anyone knows of lemon cookie they really enjoy I'd love to hear about it. 
There are some lemon cookies I like like these[are great](https://www.tatesbakeshop.com/cookies/flavors/new-lemon-cookies) but they don't have any icing.
