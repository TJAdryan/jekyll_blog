For weeks now, I've been on a quiet, personal quest: the search for the perfect lemon cookie. It's not some grand, dramatic saga; it's just a simple desire to find that one, cookie that delivers a bright, zesty, and utterly satisfying lemon experience. No, I don't know what is wrong with me. I just want what I want.

So for a while now, I have been going to different grocery stores and looking for lemon cookie mixes or lemon-flavored cookies. The only ones with icing I could find were [lemon Oreos](https://www.oreo.com/products/oreo-lemon-cookies?Size=2+Pack). I thought, well if this is the only one's they have, I will give them a try. I like regular Oreos...

I opened the package on the walk home. The cookie part had no lemon flavor, it was like one of those regular 'Golden' Oreos. The filling was okay. It had a mild lemon flavor but not what I was hoping for. I understand in psychology, some people are maximizers and some are satisficers. This is one of the times I am a maximizer. I don't want to be, because maximizers are always looking for the best. But the rub is that even when they find it, they have a comparatively less enjoyable experience than satisficers. So I am fated to fail?

I don't know what specific lemon cookie from my past set this high, yet seemingly unachievable, bar. But its memory drives my continued search. It might be that I am nostalgic or have unrealistic expections. Anyway if anyone knows of lemon cookie they really enjoy I'd love to hear about it.
There are some lemon cookies I like. These [are great](https://www.tatesbakeshop.com/cookies/flavors/new-lemon-cookies) but they don't have any icing.
