# Sort of a fairytale...
Almost everything about CRISPR sounds like a magical.  Some of the first living organisms, are attacked by viruses with no way to defend themselves. Some evolve an ability that allows them to snip the RNA out of the virus and hold on to it protecting themselves from future attacks. Thousands of years later, humans learn this secret and figure out how to use it save the lives of other humans.

This week I read that a [child](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/health/gene-editing-personalized-rare-disorders.html) that had virtually no chance of survival, seems to have been saved by this technology. They call the kid KJ, and if it worked for him they might be able to save thousands or even millions of other lives. The speficific disease is called [AADC deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10000000/) and it is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain's ability to produce dopamine and serotonin. But there is good reason to believe the same techniques could be used to treat other diseases as well.

That is not even the only use for CRISPR. Here is a python library used to help identify [similar looking plants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38768250/) potentially to help identify invasive species more reliably. I am sure there will be countless other uses for this technology. If you are interested in exploring more with python, here is a [link](https://depmap.org/portal/data_page/?tab=overview) to the DepMap portal. It is a great resource for exploring CRISPR in the context of cancer research. A great primer on Bioinformatics is the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) library
