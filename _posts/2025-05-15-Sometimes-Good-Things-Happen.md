# # The Fairytale of CRISPR: Long Ago and Far Away in a Prokaryote...
Almost everything about CRISPR sounds like a fairytale. The first living organisms, are attacked by viruses with no way to defend themselves. Some evolve an ability that allows them to snip the RNA out of the virus and hold on to it as a protection in case they are ever attacked by the same virus. Thousands of years later, humans learn this secret and figure out how to use it save the lives of other humans.

This week I read that a [child](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/health/gene-editing-personalized-rare-disorders.html) that had virtually no chance of survival, seems to have been saved by this technology. They call the kid KJ, and if it worked for him they might be able to save thousands or even millions of other kids in the future.

That is just one of the many uses for CRISPR. Here is a python library used to help identify [similar looking plants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38768250/) potentially to help identify invasive species more reliably. I am sure there will be countless other uses for this technology.  If you are interested in exploring more with python, here is a [link](https://depmap.org/portal/data_page/?tab=overview) to the DepMap portal. It is a great resource for exploring CRISPR in the context of cancer research.
