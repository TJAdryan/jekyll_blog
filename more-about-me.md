**Less formal Stuff:**

I started this blog for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I genuinely believe in sharing knowledge, but let's face it, we forget most of what we learn, documenting it won't prevent that but it helps.  Secondly, I wanted a space to explore data engineering and related topics with a bit more personality â€“ maybe even *fun*, ~~probably~~ hopefully. Finally, I can't resist a good anecdote, so this will never be 100% technical content.   


Data is an incredibly broad and complex field, I am sure many of you have had the same experience of realizing there are too many things for one person to know. My goal here isn't just to present dry technical facts but to share the *how* and the *why*, we all want to have perfect projects that perform flawlessly but that isn't true for most of us.  

**Other Stuff:**

I love New York City where I work and live and enjoy a bit of everything it has to offer. I have a distrust for automobiles, but when I do drive, I get the appeal. Maybe it is just the metaphor of spending all your time in a box, maybe it was reading [The Power Broker by Robert Caro](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Broker-Robert-Moses-Fall/dp/0394720245) at an impressionable time in my life. Like many people, my contradictions probably say as much about me as my convictions. I love reading and there are just too many good books and not nearly enough time.

I'm always keen to connect with fellow data enthusiasts! Feel free to reach out, I love a good story and I feel like most people have one or more to tell. I appreciate all feedback, I promise to read it all.
