  <summary>As someone who looks back at their own code and sees a mix of pride and regret, I am often torn between the desire to improve what is there and the fear of breaking something that already works. I am sure this is a common feeling, and not just something I suffer from (right?). However, sometimes there are opportunities to make small, incremental improvements that can lead to significant perform...</summary>

  <summary>I am always looking for ways to improve my data pipelines, and Dagster has been really good to me so far.  I am definitely planning on diving further into it in the future but my initial experiences have been favorable.  Of course, I ran into a a few issues.  But mostly I was able to get things up and running, without too much trouble, and get value from using it right away.  I tried to keep it...</summary>

  <summary>taking it personally.  NYC Restaurant Inspections Data Pull  When I was making the DuckDB posts, I wanted to include some code to show how to pull the data from the NYC Open Data portal. In the interest of keeping it simple, I just showed how to download the data.  Here’s a separate post that provides a simple way to pull the data programmatically, if you haven’t accessed the NYC Open Data port...</summary>

  <summary>Hoping for an A.  In Part I , we got our feet wet by performing initial data explorations on the NYC restaurant inspection dataset directly from a CSV file. We saw how DuckDB allows for quick insights without full data loading into memory.  I felt like I didn’t get to cover everything I wanted to touch in the last post so here I will focus on some of the other capabilities namely as a lightweig...</summary>

  <summary>Hoping for an A.  Pandas has been my go-to tool for data manipulation in Python for years. So great for me, right?  End of blog post.  Except…  “If the only tool you have is a hammer, you will see every problem as a nail.” This dollop of wisdom, often attributed to Maslow, reminds us that the solutions we find are often shaped by the tools we have available. I’m not calling Pandas a hammer; it’...</summary>
